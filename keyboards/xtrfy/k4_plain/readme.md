# Xtrfy K4 TKL ISO

_Xtrfy K4 TKL RGB_, but RGB is not supported here.

Based on Keychron K8 files in `qmk_firmware/keyboards/keychron/k8/`. For ANSI and RGB support, this may a be good place to start.

To compile: `qmk compile -kb xtrfy/k4_rgb_plainn/plain/iso -km iso`

TODO:
- add ANSI support
- add RGB support
- fix CapsLock LED
- clean RGB elements from plain
